# 5-in-a-row tic-tac-toe

Dead simple realisation of classic game focused on multiplayer interaction.
Working example is available on [pythonanywhere.com](http://tictactic.pythonanywhere.com/).

Based on [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and [jCanvas](https://github.com/caleb531/jcanvas).
Developement was spontaneous and hence don't expect much from the result.
Interaction with client based on repetative AJAX requests for minimisation of server requirements.

### Some characteristics:
+ Session based user indentification.
+ User inteface is based on hmtl canvas.
+ Infinite game board with scroll/zoom option.
+ Win condition is calculated by server after each move.
+ There is no win indication, so players can do with gameboard anything they want.


jCanvas and jQuery are shamelessly included in repository for simplisity.

Cheers.
